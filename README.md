# Overview

This project contains code for my DS 785 - Capstone Project titled 'Providing User Specific LMS Content Recommendations Using Machine Learning'. All data has been anonymized.

The primary goal of this project was to build a hybrid content recommendation engine using callaborative and content-based filtering. To accomplish this, KNN and Neural Networks were used in a hybrid approach to achieve 81.5% predictive accuracy. 

Full commentary on this project is provided in the final paper. For access to this paper (those outside of UWEX), please contact me at 17arhomberg@gmail.com.
